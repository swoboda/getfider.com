### 1. Merge duplicate ideas

It's now possible to mark an idea as a Duplicate of another idea. This is particular useful to clean up the ideas list when someone shares an idea that has already been posted before.

When an idea is marked as a duplicate, it will show a link to the original idea and all its votes will be added to it as well.

### 2. Sort by trending

Fider now shows trending ideas by default instead of recent ones. A trending idea is one that has received a few votes or comments in recent days, the more events happening on this idea, the more likely it's to bubble up on the list. Recent ideas also start as trending for a few days, but it'll move down the list if it doesn't get any interaction.

The algorithm is actually based on HackerNews, with a few adjustments. We're looking forward for feedback on how we can improve it!

### 3. Update user e-mail

It's now possible for users to update the e-mail address from their Fider account. This might not be a common situation for most people, especially because we don't have any real use for this information. But with the upcoming notification feature, this turned into a must have configurable setting. As always, a e-mail confirmation is required when changing the e-mail.
