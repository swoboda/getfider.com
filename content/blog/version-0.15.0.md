In this release we've focused on authentication improvements for Fider. For a long time we have enabled visitors to sign in via Facebook, Google, GitHub and email, but that's not enough. Custom providers was a highly requested feature so that we could have authentication via Twitch, Discord, Spotify, Azure AD, Strava and many many others.

### #1: Custom OAuth

From the `Site Settings -> Authentication`, Administrators are now able to configure authentication with any provider that supports OAuth2. We have enhanced our documentation <a href="/docs/configuring-oauth">on how to configure OAuth</a>, so if you're looking into integrating other providers into your Fider instance, have a look on it to learn how to do that.

### #2: An API is coming soon!

Release 0.15 was supposed to include a Public API, but that has been postponed to 0.16 due to unforeseen events. But we've made a good progress on it and this release actually includes a bunch of changes that are not yet visible. So sit back and relax, the API is coming soon!
