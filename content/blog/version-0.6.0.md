### 1. Sign in by email

We heard more than once that required users to use their Social accounts to sign in is not the way to go. Some people might not have these accounts or don't want to link they because of privacy concerns, which is totally understandable!

With this in mind, we are happy to release v0.6.0 with a very simple sign in by email process. There's no need for users to fill in any form, all they need to do is type their email and click on the link that we send.

If you have any feedback on this, please share it on the [official idea](https://feedback.fider.io/ideas/15/add-sign-up-form-as-alternative-to-social-auth) that originated this feature.

This release also includes, for the first time, support to sending emails which might be used later on for other features like notification.

### How to update

Running an old Fider version? Don't worry, the upgrade process is just a matter of updating your Docker container to the latest stable image on Docker Hub. Use <code>getfider/fider:stable</code> to make sure you're always running the stable version.
