### #1: List of Voters

Our [most wanted feature](https://feedback.fider.io/posts/33/list-who-voted) has been implemented! 🎉

It's now possible to see the list of everyone who voted on a given post. We've added another sidebar panel to the post, like the following:

</figure>

Staff members can drill down and see more information about everyone who voted on that post by clicking on **+x more**. Visitors doesn't have this access because this includes private information.

### #2: Better User Management

The Members page has been redesigned to include features such as **list of all registered users** and **block user**.

Just like previous release where we released the **delete comment** feature, blocking a user allows site administrators to prevent spam by blocking spammers so they cannot access the Fider site anymore. This is a small feature, but very important to keep the house clean and fight spam and trolls.

### #3: Office 365 as a SMTP Service

Thanks to [@oxynux](https://github.com/oxynux), Fider can now use Office 365 to send e-mails. Up until now, Fider would only be compatible with SMTP services that implemented **PLAIN** authentication. oxynux implemented **LOGIN** and **CRAM-MD5** authentication mechanism, which is supported by Office 365 and many other services. Thank you for your contribution! 🥳

### #4: Fider on a Diet (part 2)

Last release we mentioned that we'd be improving performance and recuding the bundle size of Fider even more. And we did it! 😄

To know more about it, we wrote a in depth article on **how we reduced the bundle size by 67%**, you [can read it here](https://getfider.com/blog/how-we-reduced-initial-jscss-size/). Special thanks to [@cfilby](https://github.com/cfilby) for your help on implementing Code Splitting!
