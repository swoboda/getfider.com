In this release we've focused on technical improvements, but we managed to deliver minor features as well. This is a necessary step towards building a product that can be further enhanced with new features. 

### #1: Filter ideas that I voted

We've included a new filter option: **My Votes**. This option will show all ideas that the current signed in user has already voted on. It is only available for signed in users

### #2: Make comment optional when responding to an idea

Previously, when respoding to an idea, it was required to input a comment. With v0.14, this comment is now optional.

### #3: Experimental Support for CDN

We've introduced new settings that allow administrators to use a CDN to speed up delivery of static assets. This feature is still experimental and will be documented on next release.
