<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>Welcome to the Fider API documentation.</p>

<p>The Fider API allows you to manage Posts and other data within your Fider instance in a simple, programmatic way using conventional HTTP requests. The endpoints are intuitive and powerful, allowing you to easily make calls to retrieve information or to execute actions.</p>

<p><strong>Version</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>API v1</strong> was introduced on Fider <code>v0.16.0</code>. Make sure you&rsquo;re running the latest version of Fider to leverage the API. All Cloud users on <code>fider.io</code> are already on the latest so you can start using it right now.</p>

<p><strong>Request</strong></p>

<p>Allowed HTTP Verbs are GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. All data must be sent as JSON.</p>

<p>Requests are sent to your Fider URL using the HTTP/HTTPS protocol.</p>

    <td>400 Bad Request</td>
    <td>Something is incorrect with your request, it might be missing a parameter or have an invalid value. See <strong>Error Messages</strong> below.</td>

    <td>404 Not Found</td>
    <td>The resource you're looking for doesn't exist.</td>
  </tr>

    <td>500 Internal Error</td>
    <td>This generally indicates a server-side problem on Fider and it cannot fulfill your request currently.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Error Messages</strong></p>

<p>Every <code>400 Bad Request</code> response contains a JSON payload with details of what went wrong. Each <code>error (object)</code> contains a <code>message (string)</code> describing what is incorrect and may also contain a <code>field (string)</code> property. If the error object doesn&rsquo;t contain the field, that&rsquo;s a general error message.</p>

<pre><code>{
  &quot;errors&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;field&quot;: &quot;color&quot;,
      &quot;message&quot;: &quot;'dark' is an invalid color.&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A tag named 'suggestion' already exists.&quot;
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>
