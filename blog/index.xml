      <description>Fider is built with React and Webpack on the frontend, so the topics below will be mostly useful for teams using same stack, but the concepts can also be applied to other stacks.
Table of Contents  Webpack Bundle Analyzer Long term caching with content hash The common bundle Code Splitting on route level Loading external dependencies on demand Font Awesome and Tree Shaking Switching from big to small NPM packages Optimising the main bundle is crucial TSLib (TypeScript only)  Webpack Bundle Analyzer webpack-bundle-analyzer is a webpack plugin that generates an interactive zoomable treemap of all your bundles.</description>

      <guid>https://getfider.com/blog/version-0.13.0/</guid>
      <description>#1: Custom Branding First thing we&amp;rsquo;d like to highlight is that administratrors are now able to upload a logo for the site. This logo is shown on different places, like the Header, the error pages, favicon and also on social links. We highly recommend everyone to upload a company/product logo as this will result in a much nicer social sharing experience.
  The other big addition is the Custom CSS, which allows administrators to write their own CSS to change the design of nearly everything on the site.</description>

      <description>Introduction It&amp;rsquo;s very well known that as the size of the codebase grows, so does the complexity and time needed to maintain it. This is a common characteristic of most software programs and thus, not different for Fider.
As we evolve one version a month we need to always look back and improve older code, even those small pieces that are still working sometimes needs some love. Refactoring older code to make it easier to read, maintain and change is something we&amp;rsquo;ll be doing more often moving forward.</description>

      <description>1. Web and Email Notifications This has been, for a long time, the most wanted feature of Fider. The notification system is based on a subscription model where users are only notified about ideas they subscribed to. This can be done manually by clicking on &amp;ldquo;Subscribe&amp;rdquo; or automatically whenever they vote or comment on it.
As for Collaborators and Administrators, they automatically subscribe to all ideas, although it&amp;rsquo;s possible to unsubscribe from each idea individually.</description>

      <description>1. Sign in by email We heard more than once that required users to use their Social accounts to sign in is not the way to go. Some people might not have these accounts or don&amp;rsquo;t want to link they because of privacy concerns, which is totally understandable!
With this in mind, we are happy to release v0.6.0 with a very simple sign in by email process. There&amp;rsquo;s no need for users to fill in any form, all they need to do is type their email and click on the link that we send.</description>
